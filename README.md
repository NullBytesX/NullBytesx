    <p>
      I don‚Äôt secure systems. I break them. The deeper the security, the more fun I have destroying it. With expertise spanning numerous programming languages and advanced exploit crafting, I infiltrate, exploit, and obliterate systems without leaving a trace. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every line of code hides a flaw, every system has an Achilles' heel‚Äîmy expertise lies in uncovering these weaknesses and exploiting them to their maximum potential. I move silently, strike hard, and leave nothing behind but chaos in my wake.

### üï∂ My Black Hat Arsenal:
I specialize in breaking systems at every level. Whether it's exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities, reverse engineering binaries, or deploying rootkits, my arsenal includes everything a professional system manipulator would need.

#### **Exploitation Expertise**:
- **Custom Payload Crafting**: Writing zero-day exploits, exploiting buffer overflows, and crafting custom shellcode.
- **ROP Chains & Return-to-libc**: Mastering Return Oriented Programming to bypass modern security defenses such as ASLR and DEP.
- **Heap Exploitation**: Advanced techniques like heap spraying and exploitation of use-after-free vulnerabilities.
  
#### **Advanced Network Intrusion**:
- **Network Pivoting**: Penetrating internal networks after an external breach using tunneling techniques like **reverse TCP shells**.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**: Sniffing and injecting data in encrypted sessions via SSL strip and DNS spoofing with tools like **Bettercap**.
- **WPA2 Enterprise Cracking**: Advanced wireless cracking with EAP phishing attacks using **Evil Twin** setups.

### üñ• Full Stack Sabotage + Offensive Programming:
Not just a hacker‚ÄîI'm a full stack developer who knows how to build and tear down applications from the ground up. Understanding every aspect of the web stack allows me to exploit even the most intricate vulnerabilities.

#### **Server-Side Vulnerabilities**:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Exploiting vulnerable API endpoints to gain shell access.
- **File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)**: Using path traversal to execute system commands or read sensitive files.
- **Deserialization Attacks**: Crafting malicious serialized objects to achieve arbitrary code execution.
  
#### **Web Application Manipulation**:
Not just simple XSS‚Äîthis goes deeper:
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**: Gaining internal network access through poorly validated inputs.
- **WebSocket Attacks**: Hijacking real-time communication protocols.
- **Command Injection**: Using unsanitized user inputs to execute system commands.

### üíÄ Stealthy Operating Systems:
I operate on highly secure, hardened Linux distributions built for stealth and speed. Perfect for bypassing intrusion detection systems and avoiding forensic traces:
- **Parrot Security OS**: Built for covert offensive operations, packed with bleeding-edge hacking tools.
- **Arch Linux**: A minimalist setup where every installed tool is carefully curated for maximum efficiency.
- **NixOS**: Extreme isolation and reproducibility make it ideal for evading detection while running custom exploits.
- **Qubes OS**: Compartmentalization at its finest, ensuring each action is isolated from the rest of the system.
- **Void Linux**: Lightweight and optimized for speed, perfect for attack setups on low-resource systems.

### üî• Crafting Zero-Day Exploits:
Developing custom exploits requires precision and creativity. My deep knowledge of system internals and vulnerabilities allows me to create exploits that break through the most robust defenses:
- **Heap Corruption**: Identifying heap overflow vulnerabilities and leveraging them to hijack program control flow.
- **ROP Chains**: Developing Return Oriented Programming chains to bypass modern security mitigations.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities to escalate from user to root-level access on compromised machines.

#### **Obfuscation & Anti-Forensics**:
- **Rootkits**: Deploying custom rootkits to hide processes, files, and network connections from system admins.
- **Anti-forensics**: Deleting logs, tampering with timestamps, and using advanced techniques like **memory injection** to remain undetected.
- **Code Obfuscation**: Utilizing tools like **UPX** and custom obfuscation techniques to evade static and dynamic analysis.

---

### üß© Reverse Engineering & Code Manipulation:
- **Ghidra & IDA Pro**: The decompilers of choice, perfect for tearing down binaries and uncovering exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Frida & Radare2**: Dynamic instrumentation and low-level binary analysis, ideal for uncovering the deepest flaws in software.
- **Binary Ninja**: Quick and efficient for analyzing malware and cracking DRM protections.
  
#### Custom Exploit Development:
- **Exploit Dev Tools**: Crafting custom payloads using **ROPgadget**, **Pwntools**, and **LibFuzzer** to find flaws in complex systems.
- **Memory Manipulation**: Exploiting buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and use-after-free bugs to seize control of applications.
- **Kernel Hacking**: Finding privilege escalation exploits in Linux kernels using tools like **Syzkaller** and **AFL**.
